# Web Applications: Lab 2 Repository

This repository contains the stateless Todo List App


### Statelessness

While the app does manage some state, it does not store this state outside of the session. There's no backend database, no local storage, or cookies to persistently save the state.

Once the page is refreshed, any "todos" you added, any "user" you logged in as will be reset. You'll start with a blank slate each time you refresh.
